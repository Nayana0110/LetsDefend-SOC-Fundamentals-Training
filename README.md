# SOC Types and Roles

What is a SOC?
A Security Operation Center (SOC) is a facility where the information security team continuously monitors and analyzes the security of an organization. 
The primary purpose of the SOC team is to detect, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity incidents using technology, people, and processes.


**Types of SOC Models**
Depending on your security needs and budget, there are several types of SOCs:



 



1) In-house SOC
This team is formed when an organization builds its cybersecurity team. Organizations considering an internal SOC should have a budget to support its continuity.

2) Virtual SOC
This type of SOC team does not have a permanent facility and often works remotely in various locations.

3) Co-Managed SOC
The Co-Managed SOC consists of internal SOC staff working with an external Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP). Coordination is key in this type of model.

4)Command SOC
This SOC team oversees smaller SOCs across a large region. Organizations using this model include large telecommunications providers and defense agencies.
