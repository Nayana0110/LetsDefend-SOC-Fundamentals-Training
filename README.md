# SOC Types and Roles

What is a SOC?
A Security Operation Center (SOC) is a facility where the information security team continuously monitors and analyzes the security of an organization. 
The primary purpose of the SOC team is to detect, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity incidents using technology, people, and processes.


**Types of SOC Models**

Depending on your security needs and budget, there are several types of SOCs:

1) In-house SOC:  This team is formed when an organization builds its cybersecurity team. Organizations considering an internal SOC should have a budget to support its continuity.

2) Virtual SOC:   This type of SOC team does not have a permanent facility and often works remotely in various locations.

3) Co-Managed SOC:  The Co-Managed SOC consists of internal SOC staff working with an external Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP). Coordination is key in this type of model.

4) Command SOC:  This SOC team oversees smaller SOCs across a large region. Organizations using this model include large telecommunications providers and defense agencies.

**People, Process, and Technology**

Building a successful SOC requires serious coordination. Most importantly, there should be a strong relationship between people, processes, and technology.
Simply put, we will discuss the people, processes, and technologies required for SOC.

**People :-**  A strong SOC team requires highly trained personnel who are familiar with security alerts and attack scenarios. Because attack types are constantly changing, you need team members who can easily adapt to new attack types and are willing to conduct research.

**Processes :-**  To further develop your SOC structure, you need to align it with many different types of security requirements, such as NIST, PCI, and HIPAA. All processes require extreme standardization of actions to ensure nothing is left out.

**Technology :-**  The team needs to have different products for many tasks, such as penetration testing, detection, prevention, and analysis, and they need to follow the market and technology closely to find the best solution for the organization. Sometimes the best product on the market may not be the best product for your team. Remember to consider other factors such as the organization's budget.
